				    <p>I am a BSIT student and a law abiding person that follow the rules of Saint Louis University. Be a considerate person and a type of person that knows the right thing to do. I WAS once a bad guy and a bully. But be like me, do not be afraid to change into something good and spread the love and peace in the campus and also in the outside world. Peace!</p>

				    <p>Hello there ! I'm currently taking up the course BSIT . Peace and Order was not really my thing until I became a student of Saint Louis University , I was once a kid who always loved to do things before planning about it , in short I was really hyped to do all kinds of things not considering if its proper or not, but since I became a part of SLU , I felt that the act of being good and being able to abide by the rules made me happier than when I was doing the exact opposite . Now I aim to have a university with peace and order , A peaceful community is a healthy community . Make peace not war :)</p>
