                    <p>Hello, I am a BSIT student of Saint Louis University, a good and caring student. I do follow the rules and regulation of SLU but there are some instance that I broke some. For example, I do stay outside the corridor the reason is that I was waiting for the previous class to dismiss because the room that they are using will be the room for our next class. Follow the rules and regulation of the university to have a peaceful university.</p>

                    <p>Hello there ! I'm currently taking up the course BSIT . Peace and Order was not really my thing until I became a student of Saint Louis University , I was once a kid who always loved to do things before planning about it , in short I was really hyped to do all kinds of things not considering if its proper or not, but since I became a part of SLU , I felt that the act of being good and being able to abide by the rules made me happier than when I was doing the exact opposite . Now I aim to have a university with peace and order , A peaceful community is a healthy community . Make peace not war :)</p>
