								Bullying tend to destroy ones person’s view of life and not attain the peace he want. You have to treat other people fairly and not bully them because of their differences because each person are unique, each person have strength and weaknesses. Don’t use that weakness to hurt others because like them, you also have weakness!</p>

				    <h3><b>NO VANDALISM!</b></h3>
								<a href="./img/DSC_0019.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="./img/DSC_0019.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>“Vandalism is the destruction of someone else's property. Some people think of graffiti as public art, while others dismiss it as nothing but vandalism.” Is it nice to you to write on a wall or to any someone else’s property? This decreases the property value, result in repeated maintenance and it will incur repair costs. If you think vandalism is an art, well you are wrong! So stop vandalism! </p>

								<a href="./img/DSC_0017.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="./img/DSC_0017.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Standing by in the corridor is not permitted because students will cause noise that may disturb classes that are going on and to also point out, that many students are struggling to enter/exit the classroom before/after their class because of the students loitering around the corridor. It will also cause an unsightly environment where some undisciplined students leave their trash to the place they reside.</p>
